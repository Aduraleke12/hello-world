# hello-world
I aim to learn the fundamental skills of web development from the ground up. With no prior background, I want to understand the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and how to create user-friendly and visually appealing websites. I am eager to explore responsive design, accessibility, and best practices for building functional websites. My goal is to develop a solid foundation that will allow me to communicate effectively through web design, leveraging my communication and event management experience to create engaging online platforms.
